# Domain 4: Identity and Access Management (IAM) Architecture

## 4.1 Design identity management and lifecycle 
- Establish and verify identity
- Assign identifiers (e.g., to users, services, processes, devices)
- Identity provisioning and de-provisioning
- Define trust relationships (e.g., federated, standalone)
- Define authentication methods (e.g., Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), risk-based, location-based, knowledge-based, object-based, characteristicsbased)
- Authentication protocols and technologies (e.g., Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML), Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS), Kerberos)

## 4.2 Design access control management and lifecycle 
- Access control concepts and principles (e.g., discretionary/mandatory, segregation/Separation of Duties (SoD), least privilege)
- Access control configurations (e.g., physical, logical, administrative)
- Authorization process and workflow (e.g., governance, issuance, periodic review, revocation)

## 4.3 Design identity and access solutions
- Access control protocols and technologies (e.g., eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML), Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP))
- Credential management technologies (e.g., password management, certificates, smart cards)
- Centralized Identity and Access Management (IAM) architecture (e.g., cloud-based, on-premise, hybrid)
