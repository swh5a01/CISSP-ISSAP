# Domain 5: Architect for Application Security 

## 5.1 Integrate Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) with application security architecture (e.g., Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM), security architecture documentation, secure coding)

- Assess code review methodology (e.g., dynamic, manual, static)
- Assess the need for application protection (e.g., Web Application Firewall (WAF), anti-malware, secure Application Programming Interface (API), secure Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML))
- Determine encryption requirements (e.g., at-rest, in-transit, in-use)
- Assess the need for secure communications between applications and databases or other endpoints
- Leverage secure code repository

## 5.2 Determine application security capability requirements and strategy (e.g., open source,Cloud Service Providers (CSP), Software as a Service (SaaS)/Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)/ Platform as a Service (PaaS) environments)
- Review security of applications (e.g., custom, Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS), in-house, cloud)
- Determine application cryptographic solutions (e.g., cryptographic Application Programming Interface (API), Pseudo Random Number Generator (PRNG), key management)
- Evaluate applicability of security controls for system components (e.g., mobile and web client applications; proxy, application, and database services)


## 5.3 Identify common proactive controls for applications (e.g., Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP))
