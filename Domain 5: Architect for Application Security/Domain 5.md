Domain 5: Architect for Application Security
--------------------------------------------

### 5.1 Integrate SDLC with Application Security Architecture

#### a. Assess Code Review Methodology:

-   **Dynamic Analysis:** Evaluates application during runtime, identifying vulnerabilities that might be exploited during operations.
-   **Manual Analysis:** Human-led analysis of the codebase, checking for vulnerabilities, logic flaws, and other potential issues.
-   **Static Analysis:** Evaluates application in a non-runtime environment, identifying vulnerabilities by examining the source code, bytecode, or binary code.

#### b. Application Protection:

-   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Protects web applications by monitoring and filtering HTTP traffic between a web application and the internet.
-   **Anti-malware:** Software that detects, prevents, and removes malicious software.
-   **Secure API:** Ensures that the Application Programming Interface (API) follows secure coding and communication practices.
-   **Secure SAML:** Ensures that Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) assertions and protocols are securely implemented.

#### c. Encryption Requirements:

-   **At-rest:** Encryption of data that is stored, e.g., in databases, filesystems.
-   **In-transit:** Encryption of data as it moves from one system or process to another.
-   **In-use:** Encryption of data being actively processed.

#### d. Secure Communications:

-   Ensuring secure and encrypted communications between applications, databases, and other endpoints to prevent data breaches and other vulnerabilities.

#### e. Secure Code Repository:

-   Use version-controlled repositories that provide audit trails, ensure the integrity of stored code, and support secure access controls.

### 5.2 Determine Application Security Capability Requirements and Strategy

#### a. Review Security of Applications:

-   **Custom:** Tailored applications built for specific use cases.
-   **COTS (Commercial Off-the-Shelf):** Ready-made applications available for purchase.
-   **In-house:** Developed internally by the organization.
-   **Cloud:** Hosted on cloud platforms, might be provided as SaaS, IaaS, or PaaS.

#### b. Application Cryptographic Solutions:

-   **Cryptographic API:** Provides functions to perform cryptographic operations such as encryption, decryption, and digital signatures.
-   **PRNG (Pseudo Random Number Generator):** Algorithm for generating sequences of numbers that approximates the properties of random numbers.
-   **Key Management:** Processes and mechanisms for the generation, distribution, storage, rotation, and disposal of cryptographic keys.

#### c. Evaluate Security Controls for System Components:

-   Determine and implement the appropriate security controls for different components, e.g., mobile apps, web clients, proxy services, application services, database services.

### 5.3 Identify Common Proactive Controls for Applications

-   Utilize resources like the **Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)**. OWASP provides a list of top web application vulnerabilities, along with guidance on prevention. Common controls include input validation, secure configuration, session management, and secure coding practices.

### General Notes on Application Security Architecture:

-   **Holistic Approach:** Ensure application security is considered throughout the application lifecycle, from design, development, deployment, maintenance, to decommissioning.

-   **Continuous Monitoring:** Continuously monitor and assess applications for vulnerabilities, and patch them as needed.

-   **Collaboration:** Collaborate with developers, operations, and other stakeholders to ensure everyone understands and contributes to application security.

-   **Education:** Provide training for developers on secure coding practices and latest vulnerabilities.

Application security ensures that applications function as intended and are free from vulnerabilities that might be exploited by malicious actors. Proper application security architecture mitigates risks and ensures data integrity and confidentiality.
