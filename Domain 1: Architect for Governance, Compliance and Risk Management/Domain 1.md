# Domain 1: Architect for Governance, Compliance and Risk Management

Domain 1 will provide the governance and compliance horison on how the architect works and what should be follows.

## 1.1 Determine legal, regulatory, organizational and industry requirements

In this chapter, the most important thing should be how we should considered to implement the suitable controls on governance the risks, The main idea on this should based on the exam outline with the following sections:

- Determine applicable information security standards and guidelines

In most of the industries, there is no solid standards or guidelines in requesting business to pass certain standard to operate. Most of the private companies had been see security brandmark as one of the advance functions and additional score of the business.

However, in some industuries, compliance should be passed before you start to operation your business like: if you need to receive credit card payment, you should go to the PCI-DSS.

The applicable of the standard should based on the business nature and it's value.

Most typically, companies otains ISO would be proundly said they are compliant by good standard. However, as the cybersecurity professional, we need to know why people typically said ISO could governance security. In ISO framework, the main idea is monitoring the process and you can control the risk. The most important idea on ISO family is generally put the different checkpoints to endorse the action. Action should be approved by certain parties to ensure all neccessary party should be informed in the process.

The standards and guidelines should be act as the criteria of acceptance on process or bahavior. In CISSP, we had well defined the differences between policy, standard, procedure and guideline. In ISSAP, the same idea should be implied on the section.

- Identify third-party and contractual obligations (e.g., supply chain, outsourcing, partners)

Third-party management should be introduced to ensure security had been formulated in controlling risk and vulnerabilities. The main management strategy should be introduced the assessment and control mindset on managing third-party vendors.

There are serval dimension on third-party management. But most properly, why business need third-party helping because the cost, schedule and scope. 

The strategy on third-party involvement in business could be the supply-chain supports, outsourcing and partnering.

The supply chain supporting is the business align the production with other business or vendor that could help to prebuild or support for the raw materials. The supply chain supporting in software development should be the opensource code or library that use in software products. 

To ensure the supply chain in software development or deployment had achieve certain level of the mature
ity, sofrware composition analysis (SCA) should be introduced to the SDLC.

- Determine applicable sensitive/personal data standards, guidelines and privacy regulations

Data privacy should be governanced by different level of the applicable laws/standards. Currently, the most restrict law on governance data privacy are GDPR and CCPA.

Such laws are standing out for two major dimension, the consents and right to be forgotten. 

In previous decade, business, even e-business had not considered to get the consents from users before they operated the business objectives. 


- Design for auditability (e.g., determine regulatory, legislative, forensic requirements, segregation, high assurance systems)
- Coordinate with external entities (e.g., law enforcement, public relations, independent assessor)
