# Domain 1: Architect for Governance, Compliance, and Risk Management
-------------------------------------------------------------------

### 1.1 Determine legal, regulatory, organizational, and industry requirements

#### a. Applicable Information Security Standards and Guidelines

-   Identify and adhere to global and local security standards like ISO 27001, GDPR, HIPAA, and industry-specific regulations.
-   Consider cybersecurity frameworks such as NIST and CSC for building robust security architecture.

#### b. Third-party and Contractual Obligations

-   Evaluate security protocols of third-party entities to ensure alignment with organizational security posture.
-   Enforce stringent security clauses in contracts and agreements with partners, vendors, and suppliers.
-   Ensure continuous monitoring of third-party adherence to security policies and regular audits.

#### c. Data Standards and Privacy Regulations

-   Understand and adhere to data protection standards like GDPR, CCPA for safeguarding personal and sensitive data.
-   Implement necessary controls for data processing, storage, transfer, and destruction to comply with regulations.
-   Ensure data encryption, pseudonymization, and other technical controls are in place to safeguard data.

#### d. Design for Auditability

-   Design systems with traceability and audit trails to facilitate forensic investigations and compliance checks.
-   Ensure system components, activities, and access are logged and immutable to unauthorized changes.
-   Maintain segregation of duties to avoid conflicts of interest and enforce least privilege access.

#### e. Coordination with External Entities

-   Establish communication protocols and liaisons with external entities like law enforcement, regulatory bodies, and assessors.
-   Plan and communicate with PR teams to manage reputational risks and formulate communication strategies for incidents.

### 1.2 Manage Risk

#### a. Identify and Classify Risks

-   Determine potential risks, their sources, and vulnerabilities in the system that may be exploited.
-   Classify risks based on their potential impact and likelihood of occurrence.

#### b. Assess Risk

-   Evaluate risks considering the organizational context, assets involved, threat landscape, and vulnerabilities.
-   Utilize quantitative and qualitative methods for risk assessment like FAIR, risk matrices, and risk heat maps.

#### c. Recommend Risk Treatment

-   Choose appropriate risk treatment strategies, whether to mitigate, transfer, accept, or avoid the risks.
-   Mitigate: Implement controls to reduce risk.
-   Transfer: Use mechanisms like insurance to transfer risk.
-   Accept: Acknowledge and document the acceptance of risks that cannot be mitigated or transferred.
-   Avoid: Alter processes or systems to eliminate the risk.

#### d. Risk Monitoring and Reporting

-   Employ continuous monitoring mechanisms using SIEM systems, IDS/IPS, and other security tools to identify and respond to risks in real-time.
-   Establish a structured risk reporting mechanism to communicate risks to relevant stakeholders, including executive management and operational teams.
-   Periodically review and reassess the risk landscape to account for new threats, vulnerabilities, and changes in the business environment.

### General Notes on Security Architecture:

-   **Holistic Approach:** Security architecture should provide a holistic approach to protect an organization from risks and should not only be technologically driven but should also incorporate processes and people.

-   **Alignment with Business Objectives:** Security measures and controls should be aligned with business objectives and enable the organization to achieve its goals without undue constraints.

-   **Defense in Depth:** Implement layered security controls across all areas of technology, processes, and people to ensure redundancy and robustness in security defense mechanisms.

-   **Scalability and Flexibility:** Ensure that the security architecture is scalable to accommodate the growth of the organization and flexible enough to adapt to evolving security threats and business needs.

Remember, a solid security architecture should interweave technology, processes, and people, thereby ensuring a robust framework that is capable of responding to ever-evolving cybersecurity threats while aligning with business goals.
