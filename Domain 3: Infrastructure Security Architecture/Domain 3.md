# Domain 3: Infrastructure Security Architecture

## 3.1 Develop infrastructure security requirements
- On-premise, cloud-based, hybrid
- Internet of Things (IoT), zero trust

## 3.2 Design defense-in-depth architecture 
- Management networks
- Industrial Control Systems (ICS) security
- Network security
- Operating systems (OS) security
- Database security
- Container security
- Cloud workload security
- Firmware security
- User security awareness considerations

## 3.3 Secure shared services (e.g., wireless, e-mail, Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), Unified Communications (UC), Domain Name System (DNS), Network Time Protocol (NTP)) 

## 3.4 Integrate technical security controls
- Design boundary protection (e.g., firewalls, Virtual Private Network (VPN), airgaps, software defined perimeters, wireless, cloud-native)
- Secure device management (e.g., Bring Your Own Device (BYOD), mobile, server, endpoint, cloud instance, storage)

## 3.5 Design and integrate infrastructure monitoring
- Network visibility (e.g., sensor placement, time reconciliation, span of control, record compatibility)
- Active/Passive collection solutions (e.g., span port, port mirroring, tap, inline, flow logs)
- Security analytics (e.g., Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), log collection, machine learning, User Behavior Analytics (UBA))

## 3.6 Design infrastructure cryptographic solutions
- Determine cryptographic design considerations and constraints
- Determine cryptographic implementation (e.g., in-transit, in-use, at-rest)
- Plan key management lifecycle (e.g., generation, storage, distribution)

## 3.7 Design secure network and communication infrastructure (e.g., Virtual Private Network(VPN), Internet Protocol Security (IPsec), Transport Layer Security (TLS))

## 3.8 Evaluate physical and environmental security requirements
- Map physical security requirements to organizational needs (e.g., perimeter protection and internal zoning, fire suppression)
- Validate physical security controls
