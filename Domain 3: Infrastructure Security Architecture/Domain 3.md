# Domain 3: Infrastructure Security Architecture
----------------------------------------------

### 3.1 Develop Infrastructure Security Requirements

#### a. On-premise, Cloud-based, Hybrid

-   **On-premise:** Consider traditional data center security measures, including physical security, network segregation, and internal firewall configurations.
-   **Cloud-based:** Design based on shared responsibility model; provider handles infrastructure security while the organization addresses data, application, and access control.
-   **Hybrid:** Address challenges of integrating on-premise and cloud security, ensuring consistent policy enforcement across environments.

#### b. Internet of Things (IoT) and Zero Trust

-   **IoT:** Ensure device authentication, secure communication, timely patching, and firmware security.
-   **Zero Trust:** Design based on the principle of "never trust, always verify." Implement strict access controls, continuous authentication, and least privilege access.

### 3.2 Design Defense-in-depth Architecture

#### a. Management Networks

-   Separate management traffic from regular network traffic for added security.

#### b. ICS Security

-   Implement segmentation, utilize gateways, and ensure regular vulnerability assessments.

#### c. Network Security

-   Implement robust firewalls, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS).

#### d. OS Security

-   Ensure hardening, patching, and disable unnecessary services.

#### e. Database Security

-   Implement encryption at rest, use secure configurations, and ensure proper access controls.

#### f. Container Security

-   Secure orchestration, ensure container hardening, and scan for vulnerabilities.

#### g. Cloud Workload Security

-   Understand shared responsibility models and use cloud-native security tools.

#### h. Firmware Security

-   Validate firmware integrity and ensure timely updates.

#### i. User Security Awareness

-   Develop and deliver user training programs to raise awareness of security threats and best practices.

### 3.3 Secure Shared Services

-   Ensure secure configurations, encryption, and robust access controls for services like wireless, email, VoIP, UC, DNS, and NTP.

### 3.4 Integrate Technical Security Controls

#### a. Design Boundary Protection

-   Use firewalls, VPNs, airgaps, software-defined perimeters, and other mechanisms to protect network boundaries.

#### b. Secure Device Management

-   Implement policies and tools for BYOD, mobile devices, servers, endpoints, cloud instances, and storage.

### 3.5 Design and Integrate Infrastructure Monitoring

#### a. Network Visibility

-   Strategically place sensors, ensure time reconciliation, span of control, and record compatibility.

#### b. Collection Solutions

-   Utilize methods such as span port, port mirroring, tap, and inline collection.

#### c. Security Analytics

-   Implement SIEM, log collection, machine learning, and UBA for improved threat detection and response.

### 3.6 Design Infrastructure Cryptographic Solutions

#### a. Design Considerations

-   Determine constraints and requirements for implementing cryptography.

#### b. Cryptographic Implementation

-   Address encryption needs for data in-transit, in-use, and at-rest.

#### c. Key Management

-   Plan for key generation, storage, distribution, and retirement.

### 3.7 Design Secure Network and Communication Infrastructure

-   Implement secure communication protocols such as VPN, IPsec, and TLS.

### 3.8 Evaluate Physical and Environmental Security Requirements

#### a. Physical Security Mapping

-   Match physical security needs with organizational requirements including perimeter protection and internal zoning.

#### b. Validate Controls

-   Ensure implemented physical controls meet the set requirements, including aspects like fire suppression.

### General Notes on Infrastructure Security Architecture:

-   **Holistic Integration:** It's essential to integrate all security components harmoniously. Each security layer should complement the others to ensure no single point of failure.

-   **Continuous Review:** Infrastructure changes over time. Regularly review and update the security design to ensure it remains effective against evolving threats.

-   **Stakeholder Collaboration:** Engage with different stakeholders, from network engineers to end-users, ensuring that security controls meet operational needs without undue hindrance.

-   **Testing:** Regularly test all security controls, from penetration testing to user awareness programs, to ensure their effectiveness.

Understanding and addressing the intricacies of infrastructure security architecture is crucial to build a resilient and secure IT environment.
