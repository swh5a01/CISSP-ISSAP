# Domain 6: Security Operations Architecture 

## 6.1 Gather security operations requirements (e.g., legal, compliance, organizational, and business requirements)

## 6.2 Design information security monitoring (e.g., Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), insider threat, threat intelligence, user behavior analytics, Incident Response (IR) procedures)
- Detection and analysis
- Proactive and automated security monitoring and remediation (e.g., vulnerability management, compliance audit, penetration testing)

## 6.3 Design Business Continuity (BC) and resiliency solutions
- Incorporate Business Impact Analysis (BIA)
- Determine recovery and survivability strategy
- Identify continuity and availability solutions (e.g., cold, warm, hot, cloud backup)
- Define processing agreement requirements (e.g., provider, reciprocal, mutual, cloud, virtualization)
- Establish Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPO)
- Design secure contingency communication for operations (e.g., backup communication channels, Out-of-Band (OOB))

## 6.4 Validate Business Continuity Plan (BCP)/Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP) architecture

## 6.5 Design Incident Response (IR) management
- Preparation (e.g., communication plan, Incident Response Plan (IRP), training)
- Identification
- Containment
- Eradication
- Recovery
- Review lessons learned
