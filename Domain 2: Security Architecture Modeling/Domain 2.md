# Domain 2: Security Architecture Modeling

## 2.1 Identify security architecture approach

- Types and scope (e.g., enterprise, network, Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), cloud, Internet of Things (IoT), Industrial Control Systems (ICS)/Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA))
- Frameworks (e.g., Sherwood Applied Business Security Architecture (SABSA), Service-Oriented Modeling Framework (SOMF))
- Reference architectures and blueprints
- Security configuration (e.g., baselines, benchmarks, profiles)
- Network configuration (e.g., physical, logical, high availability, segmentation, zones)

## 2.2 Verify and validate design (e.g., Functional Acceptance Testing (FAT), regression)

- Validate results of threat modeling (e.g., threat vectors, impact, probability)
- Identify gaps and alternative solutions
- Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V) (e.g., tabletop exercises, modeling and simulation, manual review of functions)
